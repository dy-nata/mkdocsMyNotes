- A futuristic cityscape at dusk, showcasing multiple 2024 technological innovations: a flying car soars between skyscrapers, its design sleek and aerodynamic. In the foreground, a person wearing augmented reality contact lenses interacts with holographic displays floating in mid-air. Nearby, an advanced humanoid robot assists a group of people. On the street, a self-driving electric vehicle navigates smoothly. A building fa√ßade advertises space tourism, showing a rocket launch. Through a laboratory window, scientists work with a quantum computer and 3D-printed organs. In a park, people use brain-computer interface headsets. Subtly integrated into the scene, a magnified view of nanorobots flowing through a blood vessel. The entire image should be photo-realistic, with a balance of warm and cool lighting to emphasize the cutting-edge technology against the cityscape backdrop.

- A modern, self-driving car navigating through a busy urban street, with people walking and traffic lights changing, while nearby, a person wearing a VR headset interacts with a holographic interface, and a doctor remotely consulting a patient via a tablet in a park, surrounded by advanced 6G network towers emitting light beams.
